**Each time you make changes that you want to be reflected on GitHub, 
**the following are the most common flow of commands:

git add .
git status
git commit -m "commit message"
git push -u origin master

**other git commands:
git diff // To show the changes in files not yet staged to git
git checkout // revert back to the last commited version to the Git Repo

**to make sure changes are reflected on my local copy of the repo
git pull origin master // make sure that you have the latest version of repo each time you start

**add remote origin and push:
git remote -v // list the remote connections
git remote add origin remote_repository_URL // sets the new remote
git push -u origin master // pushes changes to origin
*git push command pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote
*repository you specified as the origin
